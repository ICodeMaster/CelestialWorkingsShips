Hello again...

Anywho here are the credit which are deserved for many, many people...

First off I'd like to thank my wonderful modding team who helped me make this mod, whatever state it is in right now.
Secondly, every modder who has done something that I did not know how to do, this allowed me to learn how to mod by looking at your work.
Thirdly, everybody else who has helped who is not on the team. Thanks for your help, what ever it was, you've helped us how ever small your contribution is.

And last to the modders who've so generously allowed me to take something from their work

Thats the credits thus far. This will be updated with every update of the mod.  :)

Peace!

( PS - if you think that i've taken ur work, add me on discord and message me. )
